## Assembler

Located in the `assembler/` directory.

Assemblers for computers built in LittleBigPlanet.


### Setup

* Install Typescript: `npm install -g typescript`

* Compile with `tsc main.ts --target es2020`

* Host the files on a static server.


### Emulator

There are emulators for Parva and the V8 included in the assembler. Click "Reset" before running any program with them.

There is currently no support for interrupts.


## Chatbot

The assembler is capable for sending data directly to LittleBigPlanet using the in-game Livestream Sensor. This uses a chatbot which sends messages to your Twitch stream.

I've only configured it for personal use. If you are interested in using it yourself, message me.
