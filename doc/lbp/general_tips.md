Logic is counted TWICE on the thermo when sackboy is in the level so if you have a complicated chip, it might be best to use a sackbot. (I set the controliinator for that sackbot to a color channel as nearest player seems to lag for me in beta)

How to adjust the camera WHILE creating or moving stuff around: Pause, go to settings and in the bottom you'll see an option called ''Create'' There you'll find ''Touch create mode'' Then you can set it to ''Camera'' and be able to zoom and move the camera around, no matter what you're doing!

Faster travel in the editor: Use Oddsock or Swoop while creating, they're much faster at moving and hovering around ( Of course you'll need to change character to test in-editor )
